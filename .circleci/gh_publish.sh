# version manage: actually, we need to use git to manage the version, and use CI automatically
#   to retrieve the version. But we want to use the Overleaf to edit Latex, so it cannot make
#   make tag. So I decide to use the hand-made or script-made separate txt file to manage
#   verion.
# There are two version file:
# 1. in tex source project under the .circleci folder `latest-version.txt`
# 2. in published project `version.txt`
